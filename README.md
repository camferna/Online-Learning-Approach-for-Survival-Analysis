This repository contains the codes used to reproduce the results of our paper:

Fernandez, C., Gaillard, P., de Vilmarest, J. and Wintenberger, O. (2024). Online learning
approach for suvival analysis. [arXiv preprint arXiv :2402.05145.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05145)

The experiments were carried out with R.

- online_algorithms contains all the functions and algorithms use throughout the paper: ONS, gradient descent, BOA and SurvONS.
- MC_simulations contains the data simulation and the parameter estimation of all the online algorithms. 
- MC_results contains the graphs that show the results of the simulation section of the paper.
